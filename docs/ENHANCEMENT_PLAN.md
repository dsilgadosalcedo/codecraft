2. Shareable Projects
   - Generate short, shareable links to fork or view live code.
   - Read-only vs. editable share links with access controls.

3. GitHub Gist & Repo Integration
   - Import/export code snippets to/from GitHub Gists.
   - Basic Git flow: clone, commit, push snippets to user repos.

## Phase 4: Deployment & Extensibility (Weeks 9-11)

1. One-Click Deployment
   - Integrate with platforms (Vercel, Netlify) for instant publishing.
   - Provide preview URL post-deployment.

2. Plugin & Theming Marketplace
   - Define plugin API for community extensions (linters, formatters).
   - Create a marketplace for editor themes and plugins.

3. User Account & Settings
   - Persist user settings, project history, and custom configurations.
   - OAuth support (GitHub, Google) for seamless login.

## Phase 5: Analytics, Community & Growth (Weeks 12+)

1. Usage Analytics
   - Track feature adoption, editor performance, and error rates.
   - Dashboard for users to view project metrics.

2. Community Hub
   - Showcase featured projects and templates.
   - Discussion forum or comment threads per shared project.

3. Monetization Strategy
   - Freemium model: Basic features free, AI/integration features premium.
   - Team plans for collaboration and private repositories.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize technical stack decisions and architecture diagrams.
2. Break down phases into issues and set up project board.
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation with UI redesign and editor enhancements.
